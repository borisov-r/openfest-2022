    "After signing NDA and paying for fabrication you submit your design as a GDS or OASIS file similar to the Gerber files for PCB designs. This is your pattern that you want to fabricate on the Silicon substrate. The Fab takes your file checks if it is manufacturable using simple rules and in case everything looks good it is send for Mask manufacturing. \n",

Of course capacitors and resistors are realized also in the FEOL part.\n",

This gives opportunity by changing few masks the already working IP or design to be improved by the foundry by moving to node with smalled feature size like from 28 nm to 22 nm for example. This would reduce the size of the chip in the reticle and increase the number of chips on the wafer and also improve the performance and reduce the power consumption at the same time.\n",

The process variations account for non idealities during the manufacturing of the transistors and give the minimum, nominal and the typical performance of the transistors.

There were already open source SPICE simulators, layout generation softwares and DRC and LVS capable tools. The only thing what was missing was a free and open PDK. Before that if you want to fabricate an ASIC you need to sign NDA with the Fab and get validated PDK and you know that using this PDK you are getting proper simulations (depending on your design skills you can have variation), but in case everything works on simulation, once fabricated most times things work as expected.
